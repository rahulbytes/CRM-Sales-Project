# Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI + SQL)

This project is a dynamic Sales Performance Dashboard built using **Power BI** and **SQL**, based on a CRM-style dataset provided by **Maven Analytics**. It is designed to help **Sales Managers** monitor and evaluate their team’s performance across different quarters with interactive visuals and calculated KPIs.
